1.what is difference between JDK,JRE,JVM>?

bdfsddf
JVM is an abstarct machonoe .it is specification that provides 
runtime enviroment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JRE is runtime enviroment which impliment jvm and provides all class libraries and other files that JVM uses
at runtime.
JDK is the tool neccessory to compile,document and packeage java program.ThaJDK
completely
includes JRE

2.What is synchronization?
Synchronization is process which keeps all concurrent threds in execution 
to be in Sync.
Sychronization avoid memory consistency error caused due to in consistent
view of shared memory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.what is differenece between process and threds?

process-
=An executing instance of program is called a process
=process must use inter-process communication to communicate 
with sibling processs
=process can ony exercise control over child
process
=Any change in parent process does not affesct chile process
=run in seperate memory spaces
=process is controlled by the OS
=process is independent

Threds-
=a thred a asubset of the process
=threds can directly communicate with other threds of its process
=Threds cand exercide considerable control over threds of the same process
=An change in the main threds may affect the behivoir of the other threds of the process
=Run is shared memory spaces
=Threds are contrdolled by programmer in program
threads are dependent

4.What are Wrapper classes ?
Each of java eight primitive data types has a class dedicated to it.
These are know as wrapper as wrappper classes
beacause they Wrap the  primitive data type intoa object of the class.
primitive	Wrapper
boolean 	Boolean
byte		Byte
char		Character
int 		Integer
float		Float
double 		Double
long 		Log
short		Short
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.What is purpose does the keyword final,finally,finalize fulfill?

final=
final is used to apply restriction on class ,method and variable.final class
cant be inherited ,final
method cont be overriden and final variable value cant be changed

finally=
Finally is used to place important code,
it will be executed whether exception is hanled or not.

Finalize=
finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is 
garbage collected
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.What is difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

StringBuffer=
StringBuffer opeartion are thred-safe and synchromized where StringBulider ipeation are not 
thread-safe

StringBuffer is to be used when mulitiple threads are working on same String and StringBulider in the 
single threded envirment.
StringBuilder performance is faster when compared to StringBuffer
Because of no iverhead of Synchrnized
